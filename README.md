# Visualizing Drug Trial Data

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that employs the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to visualize results of a hypothetical drug trial concerning tumor treatment in mice. Multiple different drugs are compared for efficacy and results are graphed using Matplotlib. 

The code is capable of showing the user
- Survival rates for the mice in the trial using different medications over the 45 day trial period.
- The effect the medication had on tumor growth and tumor spread over the 45-day trial period.

The output is a series of bar and line graphs.
